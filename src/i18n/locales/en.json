        "question": "How long do Sentorise batteries last?",
        "answer": "Our LiFePO4 batteries are rated for 4000+ cycles at 80% depth of discharge. With typical RV use, this translates to 10+ years of reliable service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Sentorise batteries in cold weather?",
        "answer": "Yes, all our batteries include low-temperature charge protection that prevents charging below 0°C to protect cell integrity. Our Plus series includes self-heating for operation down to -20°C."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are your batteries compatible with my existing solar setup?",

        "answer": "Download the Sentorise app from the App Store or Google Play. Turn on Bluetooth on your phone, open the app, and it will automatically detect nearby Sentorise batteries. See our complete Bluetooth Setup Guide for step-by-step instructions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I connect multiple batteries in parallel?",
        "answer": "Yes, our Core and Plus series batteries can be connected in parallel to increase capacity. We recommend connecting up to 4 batteries in parallel for optimal performance. Always match batteries of the same model and state of charge."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between Lite, Core, and Plus series?",
        "answer": "Lite series (6-50Ah) is for portable and backup applications. Core series (100Ah) is our standard RV/solar battery in various formats (Standard, MINI, DIN H8). Plus series (200Ah) includes self-heating for cold climates down to -20°C."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a special charger for LiFePO4 batteries?",
        "answer": "We recommend using a charger with a LiFePO4 profile (14.4V-14.6V charge voltage). Many modern RV converters have a lithium mode. Never use a charger above 14.6V as this can damage the cells."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I try to charge below 0°C?",
        "answer": "The built-in BMS will prevent charging below 0°C to protect cell health. For cold-weather charging, use our Plus 200Ah Heated model which activates self-heating at -10°C. Discharging works down to -20°C on all models."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make a warranty claim?",
        "answer": "Contact support@sentorise.com with your registration email and describe the issue. We'll guide you through diagnosis. If replacement is needed, we ship a new unit before you return the old one (in most EU countries)."
